# Python-VPP (DEVELOPEMENT-STATE)
3-DOF Velocity Prediction Program base on the [ORC](https://www.orc.org/index.asp?id=21) aero and hydro dynamic models. The code make use of Object-oriented-Programming to be very general.

## Getting Started
### To Do List (prioritized)
1. ~~wrap rig into yacht class~~, and update measure functions
2. validate on YD-41 (Principle of Yacht Design), and write tests
3. ~~optimize the boat velocity with the 3-DOF equlibrium as constraints (Lagrange multipliers)~~
4. Add all the windag contributions (mast, crew, rigging, etc.)
5. Optional Delft hydro model
6. Add dagerboards to the possible appendages  
6. ~~tidy plotting and results~~

### Prerequisites
